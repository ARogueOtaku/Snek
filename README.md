### Story:
>*You are a lonely snake roaming in the forest one fine day and suddenly you see a bright pink square in the distance. Curious enough you are wiggling your way to the strange thing and to your horror the whole place turn pitch black and you start suffocating. You turn back and try to escape but to no avail. Everytime you go out of the darkness you just seem to re-enter the same place with that shining pink square just sitting there. After a few hopeless tries of escaping you cannot hold your breath anymore and finally decide to eat that thing. I mean you are a snake, what else can you do. It tastes good and also seems to somehow escape the suffocation for a while. You start to find a way out and suddenly another pink square appears in the distance. Is this how you will live the rest of your life? Or will you ever find a way out?*
